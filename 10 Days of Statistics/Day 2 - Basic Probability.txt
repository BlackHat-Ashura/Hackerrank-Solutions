In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.


ANSWER : 5/6

'''
SOLUTION :

From a 6x6 matrix only sum<=9 are selected.

(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4)
(6,1) (6,2) (6,3)

6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 30

P = 30/36 = 5/6
